This program calculates TOP tunings (Tenney OPtimal or Tempered Octaves 
Please) for regular temperaments (abstract musical scale systems which, 
in general, are neither equal temperaments nor just intonation).

If you don't know what most of those words mean, this program will not 
be useful to you!
